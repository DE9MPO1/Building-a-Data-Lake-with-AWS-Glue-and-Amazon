The following procedures help you set up a data lake that could store and analyze data that addresses the challenges of dealing with massive volumes of heterogeneous data. A data lake allows organizations to store all their data—structured and unstructured—in one centralized repository.

This tutorial walks you define a database, configure a crawler to explore data in an Amazon S3 bucket, create a table, transform the CSV file into Parquet, create a table for the Parquet data, and query the data with Amazon Athena.
